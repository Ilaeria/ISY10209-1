            <h1>Skills: Web Development - Website Issues</h1>
                <p>
                    When creating a website there are many different issues to consider, such as security, privacy, ethics, copyright, and cultural sensitivity. Listed below are the issues considered when creating this website.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Security and Access Control</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This website is publically available, as it is my public portfolio. Access to edit the website requires authentication.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Virus/Malware Attacks</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This website is hosted on a secure server by the university. It should therefore have up-to-date virus and malware protection.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Copyright and Intellectual Property</dt>
                    <dd>
                        To protect myself from copyright issues, I have been careful to only include content I have created myself. If content from elsewhere was required, it has been appropriately attributed.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Privacy</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The only private information displayed on this website is my own. I have only included photos of myself and my pets. I ensured that my resume page does not include the private information of other people. The "Kings Music Store" example form does not store private information.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Defamation</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is my own personal portfolio and does not contain ny information that may be damaging to another entity.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Societal and Cultural Considerations</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It's important to remember that websites are accessible worldwide. While this website is primarily targeted at a specific Australian audience, it may be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world. Further, Australia is a multicultural society. You cannot assume that something which is acceptable for you will always be acceptable for others, no matter how small your audience.<br><br>
                        It was also important to me to be respectful of the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities of Australia. I read publications from both Queensland (Queensland Government Department of Communities & Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships 2005) and New South Wales (Aboriginal Services Branch & Aboriginal Reference Group 2009) governments. I learned, for example, that you should be respectful of deceased people and not show images of them or refer to them by name.
