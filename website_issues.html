                <h2>Website Issues</h2>
                    <p>
                        When creating a website there are many different issues to consider, such as security, privacy, ethics, copyright, and cultural sensitivity. Listed below are the issues considered when creating this website.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Security and Access Control</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This website is publically available, as it is my public portfolio. Access to edit the website requires authentication.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Virus/Malware Attacks</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This website is hosted on a secure server by the university. It should therefore have up-to-date virus and malware protection.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Copyright and Intellectual Property</dt>
                        <dd>
                            To protect myself from copyright issues, I have been careful to only include content I have created myself. If content from elsewhere was required, it has been appropriately attributed.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Privacy</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The only private information displayed on this website is my own. I have only included photos of myself and my pets. I ensured that my resume page does not include the private information of other people. The "Kings Music Store" example form does not store private information.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Defamation</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This is my own personal portfolio and does not contain ny information that may be damaging to another entity.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            It's important to remember that websites are accessible worldwide. While this website is primarily targeted at a specific Australian audience, it may be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world. Further, Australia is a multicultural society. You cannot assume that something which is acceptable for you will always be acceptable for others, no matter how small your audience.<br><br>
                            It was also important to me to be respectful of the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities of Australia. I read publications from both Queensland (Queensland Government Department of Communities & Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships 2005) and New South Wales (Aboriginal Services Branch & Aboriginal Reference Group 2009) governments. I learned, for example, that you should be respectful of deceased people and not show images of them or refer to them by name. Therefore, I was careful not to mention any deceased relatives in my biography.

                <h2>Web Hosting Options Report</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many factors to consider when choosing a website hosting provider. The table below outlines these factors and the performance of three different possible hosting providers: GoDaddy (GoDaddy Operating Company 2016), Digital Pacific (Digital Pacific 2016), and UberGlobal (Uber Global 2016). 
                    </p>
                    <p>                
                        All 3 options considered offered cPanel hosting tools. cPanel is a web hosting control panel which provides tools and statistics for website administrators (Wikipedia 2015). cPanel also allows easy install of various apps, e.g. WordPress&reg;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prices quoted in the table below assume a 12 month plan.

                            GoDaddy is a very well-known domain name registrar and was the only brand name I immediately recognised of the 3 options considered. However, they are registered in the USA, not Australia.
                            <br><br>GoDaddy offers different plans for Windows or Linux operating systems, but the prices and features appear to be comparable. They didn't specify the web server for either type of plan; it's assumed they are running Apache on Linux plans and IIS on Windows plans.
                            <br><br>Their price advertised was "$4.99/month on sale, $10.99/month when you renew". The ongoing price is listed in the above table. You can get the cheaper price if you sign up for 12/24/36 months in advance. Their minimum renewal period is 3 months. 
                            <br><br>It's not clear if GoDaddy offers daily backups for free or if you have to pay: they offer a paid "Site Backup & Restore" feature for $2.99/month, but that may just be for an assisted service.
                            <br><br>GoDaddy ranked clear first in 5 categories and first equal in 3 categories.

                            Digital Pacific is an Australian company, providing carbon neutral web hosting options. They provide a lot of different plans.

                    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>
                            GoDaddy was the only provider reviewed to offer either Linux or Windows plans, and at a comparable price. Even though they are not an Australian company, they are well-known and reliable and offer a range of services to suit clients with different needs. Based on this reseach, I would choose GoDaddy as my hosting provider.
