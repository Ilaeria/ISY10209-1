            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying towards a Bachelor of Information Technology through Southern Cross University, part-time through distance education while I work full-time. My major is Software Development and my current GPA is 6.33 (with 7 being the maximum available). I have received the WIT@SCU Excellence Award for both Applications Development and Principles of Programming. I hope to maintain this record and to receive the Recognition of Academic Excellence Award each year I study. I have a previous Bachelor of Arts degree from Victoria University of Wellington, with majors in English Literature and Classical Studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My full-time job is as the IT Project Coordinator for an online dating company. This is a varied and busy job in a fascinating industry. I have a strong background in customer experience, adminstration, and fraud analysis. I'm hoping that my studies will enable me to improve and expand my current role. I particularly enjoy learning about User Experience Design and would like to focus on this area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I live with my husband and our three fur-babies (one dog, Phoebe, and two cats, Jeddah and Bubbles) on the Gold Coast, in a house that we recently had custom-built. I'm originally from New Zealand but have lived in Australia for over 10 years, and on the Gold Coast since 2006. I love the weather and the relaxed atmosphere on the Gold Coast, but I'm not a fan of all the dangerous animals in Australia.

                        Phoebe is a 15-year-old cross-breed dog I have had since she was around 6 months old. She is about the size of a kelpie, with black-and-tan colouring. Everyone has a theory about her breed mix but no one knows for sure. She's not quite in proportion - her legs are a bit too short, her body a bit too long, her ears a bit too big. Her age is starting to show: she has very bad arthritis and is mostly blind and deaf.

                        Jeddah is a 9-year-old domestic long hair black cat. Her coat is very long and silky. She has a strong, distinctive meaow and enjoys having conversations with humans.

                        Bubbles is a 7-year-old domestic short hair silver tabby cat. She is best friends with Phoebe and thinks Phoebe is another cat. She doesn't know how to meaow properly and just squeaks instead. Her name is taken from an episode of the first series of Blackadder and is short for "Beelzebubbles", Edmund's cat.
